# CS118 Project 2

This is the repo for Winter 2023 cs118 project 2.

## Makefile

This provides a couple make targets for things.
By default (all target), it makes the `server` and `client` executables.

It provides a `clean` target, and `tarball` target to create the submission file as well.

You will need to modify the `Makefile` USERID to add your userid for the `.tar.gz` turn-in at the top of the file.
